# Declaration Merging TS
This project aims to demonstrate the use of the declaration merging feature of typescript.
Each example demonstrates a way to implement a time counter for requests executed with axios.
The last example (sample03.ts), defines extended properties for the axios from declaration merging.
This project was created for study purposes only.
